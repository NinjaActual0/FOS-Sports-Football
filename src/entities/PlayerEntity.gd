## A single football player.
##
## Movement is generated from measurables plus the current physical state of the
## body and the field. There is no hidden "win the rep" check anywhere in this
## class.
##
## Cutting and spinning are NOT animations with success rolls. They are two ways
## the same force budget gets spent:
##
##   Cut   - you must kill forward momentum before the new direction can take
##           over. Sharp angle at high speed = more speed lost. A well-timed
##           plant trades less speed because the planted foot can push harder
##           laterally.
##   Spin  - you keep most of your momentum but give up your ability to
##           accelerate laterally while rotating. Good for escaping leverage
##           when a defender is committed; bad if you spin into open space.

## a runner again until you are back on your feet. Nothing about it is a roll:
